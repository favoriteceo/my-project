Hey World, my name is NICHOLAS SCOTT ATWELL Founder and CEO of Favorite.com

I created this social network to allow the world to express whatever their Favorite things maybe, and also a way for their Favorite's to be recognized.
For example my Favorite actor is Leonardo Dicaprio, I can give reasons why, but I don't have to. And now he can be directly connected to receive recognition as an actor.
